# Interview Scheduler

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

Inteview Schedular is a user-friendly, single-page application. It allows the user to book interviews with interviewers from 12pm to 5pm daily. A user can add, edit, and delete an appointment with any of the available interviewers. Dummy Data is coming from an API that the app makes put and delete requests to. A user can choose any day of the week to update their appointments.

The side-bar holds the days of the week with a dynamic counter to show how many interview spots are available in that day. Any day can be clicked to be accessed
